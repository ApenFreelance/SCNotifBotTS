# Models

## What are models?
In this project `models` refer to *database* models, specifically schemas for Sequelize.

## Why are they so ugly and verbose?
Because Sequelize says so. I do not like it, but I'm not about to rewrite it with something else before I'm done with everything else.  
For more information, refer to the [Sequelize TypeScript documentation](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/typescript/).
